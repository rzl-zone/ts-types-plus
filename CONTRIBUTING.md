## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. **Fork the repository**  
    _Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of the [**repository page**](https://github.com/rzl-zone/ts-types-plus)._  
    This creates your own copy of the project under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**

    ```bash
    # If you're contributing via a personal fork
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/ts-types-plus.git

    # Or, if you're part of the rzl-zone organization
    git clone https://github.com/rzl-zone/ts-types-plus.git

    # Navigate into the project directory
    cd ts-types-plus
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Create a new branch**  
    It‚Äôs best practice to work on a dedicated feature branch instead of the **`main` br**anch.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
    ```

5. **Make your changes, add tests script if needed**  
    _Make your updates or add new utilities, then run the test suite and build the project:_

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

6. **Commit your changes**  
    *Use clear and descriptive commit messages that follow the conventional commit style:*

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: add my awesome feature"
    ```

7. **Push to your fork**

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
    ```

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**  
    Go to your fork on GitHub, click Compare & pull request, and submit your **PR**.  
    *Please ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest **`main`** before submitting.*

> üßë‚Äçüíª **For internal contributors:**  
>    Use the `main` branch for maintenance or version bumps only, all features and fixes should go through a feature branch and PR review.

---

## Code style

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code.
- Follow the existing **folder and file structure**.
- Keep functions **small and focused**.
- Write **meaningful commit messages** (use [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).

---

## Before you submit

- Ensure the project **builds successfully**.
- Run **tests** and confirm all pass.
- Fix any **lint or TypeScript errors**.
- Rebase if your branch is behind **`main`**.
